**ipasim** (short for IPA simulator) started as my [bachelor thesis](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim/blob/master/docs/thesis/README.md).
It is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim).

In short, ipasim is UWP app for Windows 10 which can *in theory* take any iOS app (`.ipa` file) and run it.
For more details, see one-page [poster](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim/blob/master/docs/thesis/poster.pdf) and 68-page-long [thesis](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim/blob/master/docs/thesis/thesis.pdf).

I currently don't plan on improving the application (it is too much work for one person)&mdash;see [project status](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim#project-status).
But if you want to contribute, feel free to open [issues](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim/pulls).
If you have any question, use [discussions](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim/discussions) or [contact me]({{< relref "/" >}}) directly.
